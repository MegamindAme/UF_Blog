# Contributing

To Contribute to this project, please fork this repo, and then submit a pull request once you have finished. However, if you are planning to add a feature, please open an issue first so that it can be discussed.

## Branches

This project uses [GitKracken's GitFlow](https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/git-flow).

Essentially, it contains two main branches.

1. master - the master branch where the current stable release is stored.
2. develop - This is where any seperate feature/hotfix branches can be merged into. The added feature/bugfix must be stable enough to be merged into the master branch.

For every feature or bug fixed, a seperate branch must be made. For hotfixes, please use the `hotfix` folder, and for any features please use the `feature` folder.

If the bug you are fixing is a reported issue in Github, please put the issue number in the branch name.
